## Description

### Responsive Design

In this lab, I continued developing the website from Lab 2 by implementing responsive design to ensure optimal viewing across both desktop and mobile devices. I used CSS media queries to adjust element sizes, layouts, and spacing, ensuring the navbar, buttons, and sections like the FAQ and CTA adapt seamlessly to smaller screens. Additionally, I added a mobile-only 'Download Our App' section to enhance the mobile user experience.

Here are all the sections on mobile resolution:

`navbar`

`Hero Section`

`Value Proposition`

And here is the mobile-only `Download App` section:

### Mascot

For the second part of the requirements, I added a mascot to the website—a gaming controller that aligns with the gaming theme. The mascot appears in the bottom-right corner after a 5-second delay, animated with a tilting motion to make it visually appealing. When hovered, it displays a welcome message ('Ready to level up? Let’s play!'), encouraging users to interact with the site.
