## Description

For this laboratory work I decided to create a Landing Page for a madeup website - Gaming Universe. It is an immersive landing page for a gaming platform that provides a smooth, secure, and customizable experience for gamers of all types. This project uses HTML and CSS as it was specified in the requirements.
